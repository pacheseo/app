# Habit Tracker App
*My Final Project*

## What It Does
This simple program helps you track habits you want to build, like drinking water or exercising.

You can:
- Add daily or weekly habits
- Mark them as complete
- Track your streaks

## What I Learned
This project taught me about using databases and making a command-line program.

I had trouble with the streak calculation but finally got it working!

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. Run: `python main.py`

## Commands
When you run the program, you'll see a menu with options to:
* Add new habits
* Complete habits
* View your habits
* Check your streaks
* Find habits you're struggling with
* Delete habits you don't want anymore

## Notes
I built this to help me keep track of habits I want to build. I wanted something simple without having to install an app.

Hope it's useful!

## Notes
I spent a lot of time on the streak calculation part! It was tricky to figure out 
how to count consecutive days/weeks properly, especially with the weekly habits.

Some things I'd like to add if I had more time:

- A GUI version with buttons (maybe using tkinter?)
- Email reminders
- Graphs to show progress
